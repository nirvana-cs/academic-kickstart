abstract: We show that the quantum Berezinian which gives a generating function of the integrals of motions of XXX spin chains associated to super Yangian $\mathrm{Y}(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$ can be written as a ratio of two difference operators of orders m and n whose coefficients are ratios of transfer matrices corresponding to explicit skew Young diagrams.
In the process, we develop several missing parts of the representation theory of $\mathrm{Y}(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$ such as q-character theory, Jacobi-Trudi identity, Drinfeld functor, extended T-systems, Harish-Chandra map.
