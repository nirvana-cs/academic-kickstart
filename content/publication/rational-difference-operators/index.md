abstract: We study solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations of the non-homogeneous periodic XXX model associated to super Yangian $\\mathrm Y(\\mathfrak{gl}\_{m|n})$. To a solution we associate a rational difference operator $\\mathcal D$ and a superspace of rational functions $W$. We show that the set of complete factorizations of $\\mathcal D$ is in canonical bijection with the variety of superflags in $W$ and that each generic superflag defines a solution of the Bethe ansatz equation. We also give the analogous statements for the quasi-periodic supersymmetric spin chains.
